Can we just sit down
Have a little conversation
Yeah I wanna talk it out
‘Cause I’m all up in my feelings
I never felt this before
And I just wanna feel some more
It used to keep casual
Now I wanna just be yours
Can we sit down
Try to have little conversation

See you got me all in my head
Every day with you is like the weekend
I try to quit but truth is I don’t want to
Yeah

Staring at the clock
Had I guess we’re diamond patient
I know you just left
But I’m missing you like crazy
I usually don’t get this far
Always cut them off before
My heart gets in too deep
